# EDA, K-Fold Cross validation on Iris data

## About the dataset
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

## Task
To predict the class of the iris plant

## Subtasks
* Perform EDA & feature exploration
* Experiment using two different training-validation-test ratios (60-20-20 & 80-10-10)
* Perform KFold Cross Validation
* Implement Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning of SVM, RF & Gradient Boosting
* Performance comparison using metrics - precision, recall, accuracy & latency
* Make inferences on the results
